What is this project?

> Draw fast on the canvas, the application will manage to detect basic shapes (only some circles for now), and will replace it by a smooth corresponding shape.

Make it work:

>- Get the folder (clone or zip)
>- Push it on a server (if you use wamp, just place the "TakeIt" folder in your www/ folder)
>- Get to the localhost folder with a browser (if you use wamp, localhost/TakeIt)
